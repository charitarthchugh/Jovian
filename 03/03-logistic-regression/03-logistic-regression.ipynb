We'll use the famous [*MNIST Handwritten Digits Database*](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) as our training dataset. It consists of 28px by 28px grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9), along with labels for each image indicating which digit it represents.

The easiest way to start executing this notebook is to click the **\"Run\"** button at the top of this page, and select **\"Run on Kaggle\"**. This will run the notebook on Kaggle, a free online service for running Jupyter notebooks (you might need to create an account).\n","\n","### Running on your computer locally\n","*(Skip this if you're running on Kaggle)* To run this notebook locally, clone this notebook, install the required dependencies using [conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/), and start Jupyter by running the following commands on the terminal / Conda prompt:\n","\n","```bash\n","pip install jovian --upgrade                      # Install the jovian library \n","jovian clone aakashns/03-logistic-regression      # Download notebook & dependencies\n","cd 03-logistic-regression                         # Enter the created directory \n","conda create -n 03-logistic-regression python=3.8 # Create an environment\n","conda activate 03-logistic-regression             # Activate virtual env\n","jupyter notebook                                  # Start Jupyter\n","```\n","\n","You can find the `notebook_id` by cliking the *Clone* button at the top of this page on Jovian.
