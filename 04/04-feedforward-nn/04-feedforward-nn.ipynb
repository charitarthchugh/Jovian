The easiest way to start executing this notebook is to click the **\"Run\"** button at the top of this page, and select **\"Run on Kaggle\"**. This will run the notebook on Kaggle, a free online service for running Jupyter notebooks (you might need to create an account).\n\n### Running on your computer locally\n*(Skip this if you are running on Kaggle)* You can clone this notebook, install the required dependencies using conda, and start Jupyter by running the following commands on the terminal:\n\n```\npip install jovian --upgrade                # Install the jovian library \njovian clone aakashns/04-feedforward-nn     # Download notebook\ncd 04-feedforward-nn                        # Enter the created directory \nconda create -n 04-feedfoward-nn python=3.8 # Create a conda environment\nconda activate 04-feedforward-nn            # Activate virtual environment\nconda install jupyter                       # Install Jupyter\njupyter notebook                            # Start Jupyter\n```\n\nOn older versions of conda, you might need to run `source activate 04-feedfoward-nn` to activate the virtual environment.

Here's what this means:\n\n* Instead of using a single `nn.Linear` object to transform a batch of inputs (pixel intensities) into a batch of outputs (class probabilities), we'll use two `nn.Linear` objects. Each of these is called a layer in the network. \n\n* The first layer (also known as the hidden layer) will transform the input matrix of shape `batch_size x 784` into an intermediate output matrix of shape `batch_size x hidden_size`, where `hidden_size` is a preconfigured parameter (e.g. 32 or 64).\n\n* The intermediate outputs are then passed into a non-linear *activation function*, which operates on individual elements of the output matrix.\n\n* The result of the activation function, which is also of size `batch_size x hidden_size`, is passed into the second layer (also knowns as the output layer), which transforms it into a matrix of size `batch_size x 10`, identical to the output of the logistic regression model.\n\nIntroducing a hidden layer and an activation function allows the model to learn more complex, multi-layered and non-linear relationships between the inputs and the targets. Here's what it looks like visually:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vDOGEkG.png)\n![](https://st2.ning.com/topology/rest/1.0/file/get/1140047167?profile=RESIZE_710x)\n![\"ReLU\"](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/relu.png)\n\nThe activation function we'll use here is called a **Rectified Linear Unit** or **ReLU**, and it has a really simple formula: `relu(x) = max(0,x)` i.e. if an element is negative, we replace it by 0, otherwise we leave it unchanged.\n\nTo define the model, we extend the `nn.Module` class, just as we did with logistic regression.\n\n\n\n\nby introducing non linear layers(hidden), the model can \"learn\" better- paraphrashed from Akaash, Part 3, ~58:00"},{"metadata":{"id":"OS2dAbMDv79u","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def accuracy(outputs, labels):\n    _, preds = torch.max(outputs, dim=1)\n    return torch.tensor(torch.sum(preds == labels).item() / len(preds))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"3ZyMBEZgv794","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class MnistModel(nn.Module):\n    \"\"\"Feedfoward neural network with 1 hidden layer\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, in_size, hidden_size, out_size):\n        super().__init__()\n        # hidden layer\n        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(in_size, hidden_size)\n        # output layer\n        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, out_size)\n        \n    def forward(self, xb):\n        # Flatten the image tensors\n        xb = xb.view(xb.size(0), -1)\n        # Get intermediate outputs using hidden layer\n        out = self.linear1(xb)\n        # Apply activation function-has to be non-linear\n        out = F.relu(out)\n        # Get predictions using output layer\n        out = self.linear2(out)\n        return out\n    # -----------------------------------same as before---------------------------------\n    def training_step(self, batch):\n        images, labels = batch \n        out = self(images)                  # Generate predictions\n        loss = F.cross_entropy(out, labels) # Calculate loss\n        return loss\n    \n    def validation_step(self, batch):\n        images, labels = batch \n        out = self(images)                    # Generate predictions\n        loss = F.cross_entropy(out, labels)   # Calculate loss\n        acc = accuracy(out, labels)           # Calculate accuracy\n        # detach the loss to prevent all the data being loaded into the ram.\n        return {'val_loss': loss.detach(), 'val_acc': acc}\n        \n    def validation_epoch_end(self, outputs):\n        batch_losses = [x['val_loss'] for x in outputs]\n        epoch_loss = torch.stack(batch_losses).mean()   # Combine losses\n        batch_accs = [x['val_acc'] for x in outputs]\n        epoch_acc = torch.stack(batch_accs).mean()      # Combine accuracies\n        return {'val_loss': epoch_loss.item(), 'val_acc': epoch_acc.item()}\n    \n    def epoch_end(self, epoch, result):\n        print(\"Epoch [{}], val_loss: {:.4f}, val_acc: {:.4f}\".format(epoch, result['val_loss'], result['val_acc']))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"rtT6aku4v7-A"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We'll create a model that contains a hidden layer with 32 activations."},{"metadata":{"id":"uEY0GuPWv7-C","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"input_size = 784\nhidden_size = 32 # you can change this\nnum_classes = 10","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"OhJVYUzav7-K","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model = MnistModel(input_size, hidden_size=32, out_size=num_classes)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"T8EXJ8M3v7-V"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's take a look at the model's parameters.

We also used the ReLU activation function to introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex relationships between the inputs (pixel densities) and outputs (class probabilities).\n\n* We defined some utilities like `get_default_device`, `to_device` and `DeviceDataLoader` to leverage a GPU if available, by moving the input data and model parameters to the appropriate device.\n\n* We were able to use the exact same training loop: the `fit` function we had define earlier to train out model and evaluate it using the validation dataset.\n\nThere's a lot of scope to experiment here, and I encourage you to use the interactive nature of Jupyter to play around with the various parameters. Here are a few ideas:\n\n* Try changing the size of the hidden layer, or add more hidden layers and see if you can achieve a higher accuracy.\n\n* Try changing the batch size and learning rate to see if you can achieve the same accuracy in fewer epochs.\n\n* Compare the training times on a CPU vs. GPU. Do you see a significant difference. How does it vary with the size of the dataset and the size of the model (no. of weights and parameters)?\n\n* Try building a model for a different dataset, such as the [CIFAR10 or CIFAR100 datasets](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).\n\nHere are some references for further reading:\n\n* [A visual proof that neural networks can compute any function](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html), also known as the Universal Approximation Theorem.\n\n* [But what *is* a neural network?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) - A visual and intuitive introduction to what neural networks are and what the intermediate layers represent\n\n* [Stanford CS229 Lecture notes on Backpropagation](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes-backprop.pdf) - for a more mathematical treatment of how gradients are calculated and weights are updated for neural networks with multiple layers."},{"metadata":{"id":"SjqmU2Ynv8Bd","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.7.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
